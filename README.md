# personal-website
This website holds my projects and information about me for possible employers

I started creating my personal website a few years ago but since then I have changed it from just basic HTML and CSS, by using the Bootstrap framework making it easier to view on other devices.
This website holds links to my major web project and other university projects. It also hold information about me such as education and skills for possible employers.
